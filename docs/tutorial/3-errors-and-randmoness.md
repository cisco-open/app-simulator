> [!NOTE]
>
> This tutorial is work in progress.

In this tutorial we will take the simulation
[from tutorial 2](./2-a-database-and-more-services.md) and introduce errors and
randomness into the behavior of the services

If you continue from tutorial 2, open `config.yaml`, otherwise create a file
with that name in an empty directory. Fill the file with the following content:

```yaml

```
